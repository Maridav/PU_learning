# PU_learning
 This is repository for implementation of Positive-Unlabeled Learning algorithm. The two variations of this algorithm were described in paper ElkanKDD08.pdf in 2 and 3 paragraph.
 
 * 1Using_traditional_classifier.py -- Python 3 file with implementation of PU-model using traditional classifier on non-traditional input. Its output is an illustration of the method on data sampled from gaussians.
 
 * 2Weighting_unlabeled_examples.py -- Python 3 file with implementation of PU-model using weighted unlabeled examples. Its output is an illustration of the method on data sampled from gaussians.
 
 * Comparison.py -- Python 3 file with implementation of both methods to compare them on single dataset sampled from gaussians. 

 * Illustrations.pdf -- file with illustrations of results and comparison of two methods listed above.
